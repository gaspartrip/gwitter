## Final Project

The following is a sample project to put to practice all the topics learned so far. The definitions and functionalities are provided in a close to reality fashion.
You will be provided with a list of features that the sample applications must have, along with a set of wireframes to guide how the app should look like.
To accomplish the desired features, you will need to consume different services to get the data needed to populate the  views.

Use the latest version of Angular, following the app structure generated by the ng client.
